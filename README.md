In this I have done basic operations of adding an item and get item by an id without using any database storage. Here, I am using an ArrayList to store the data.

If you send the request on postman after the deployment link '/items/add' and give the input body in the JSON form as - 

{
    "name": "",
    "description": ""
}

and for getting an item by id, send the GET request as -  '/items/id' 
(ex. '/items/1' here 1 is id number)
